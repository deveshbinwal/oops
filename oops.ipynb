    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of that class. The class encapsulates data (attributes) and functionality (methods) related to a particular concept or entity.\n",

    "Let's take an example to understand this concept better. Suppose we have a class called \"Car\" that represents cars in a car manufacturing system. The Car class would define the attributes and methods associated with a car. The attributes could include properties such as \"make,\" \"model,\" \"color,\" and \"price,\" while the methods could include behaviors like \"start,\" \"accelerate,\" and \"stop.\""

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It provides data hiding and protects the internal state of an object from outside interference. Encapsulation helps maintain the integrity of the data and allows for better control and organization of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). The derived classes inherit the properties (attributes and methods) of the base class, which promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical structure. Inheritance enables the implementation of a \"is-a\" relationship, where a derived class inherits the characteristics of its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message (method call) in different ways. It allows the use of a single interface (method name) to represent different data types or objects. Polymorphism helps in achieving code flexibility, extensibility, and modularity, as it allows the programmer to write generic code that can handle different object types.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction involves the concept of creating simplified representations of complex real-world entities. It focuses on defining the essential features and behavior of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. Abstraction allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that provide a blueprint for derived classes to implement. It helps in managing complexity, improving code maintainability, and promoting code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction) provide a solid foundation for building modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems."
